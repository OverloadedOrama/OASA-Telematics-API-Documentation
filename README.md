## OASA Telematics API documentation

These are the docs for the API used in the OASA Telematics.

Most of the information was extracted from this [JS script](http://telematics.oasa.gr/js/script.js)
so if you want to help head over there first.

You can find the online docs [oasa-telematics-api.readthedocs.io](http://oasa-telematics-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Warning
Before using the API for any product, please contact OASA
in order to ask for permission or something.
